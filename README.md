## 🚀 What Is This?

Hey Spectra is the **speech-driven cognitive and emotional regulation interface** for the Iron Man–style “thought suit” I’m building.

The MVP is simple:

**You talk.  
Spectra listens.  
Spectra routes your words, tasks, and context to the right AI model.  
Spectra explains the world back to you in your language.**

This solves the real neurodivergent burden:  
**Remembering context, switching tasks, tracking conversations, and managing emotional load.**

Spectra becomes the *front door* for all communication — human or AI.

## 🎧 MVP Features (Phase 1)

### **1. Voice Activation + Continuous Listen Mode**
Open the app → press **Listen** → speak freely.  
Spectra transcribes, chunks, and buffers everything.

You can say:
- **“Complete this.”** → finish my thought  
- **“Explain it to me.”** → summarize what I meant  
- **“Explain it in my context.”** → interpret it in my emotional/intellectual framing

All speech goes into Spectra first, not directly into an LLM.

### **2. Multi-LLM Routing Layer**
Your speech is sent to the right model automatically:
