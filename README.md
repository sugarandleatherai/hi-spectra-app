# Hey Spectra / Hi Spectra  
### The Neurodivergent Communication & Context Orchestration OS  
### Voice-triggered (“Hey Spectra” / “Hi Spectra”) • Emotional Regulation Layer • Multi-LLM Router

---

## 🚀 What Is This?

Hey Spectra is the **speech-driven cognitive and emotional regulation interface** for the Iron Man–style “thought suit” I’m building.

The MVP is simple:

**You talk.  
Spectra listens.  
Spectra routes your words, tasks, and context to the right AI model.  
Spectra explains the world back to you in your language.**

This solves the real neurodivergent burden:  
**Remembering context, switching tasks, tracking conversations, and managing emotional load.**

Spectra becomes the *front door* for all communication — human or AI.

---

## 🎧 MVP Features (Phase 1)

### **1. Voice Activation + Continuous Listen Mode**
Open the app → press **Listen** → speak freely.  
Spectra transcribes, chunks, and buffers everything.

You can say:
- **“Complete this.”** → finish my thought  
- **“Explain it to me.”** → summarize what I meant  
- **“Explain it in my context.”** → interpret it in my emotional/intellectual framing

All speech goes into Spectra first, not directly into an LLM.

---

### **2. Multi-LLM Routing Layer**
Your speech is sent to the right model automatically:

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Gemini** | Fast rails / instant response paths |
| **Claude** | Long-form reasoning / structured output |
| **Grok** | Fast, loose, exploratory thought |
| **ChatGPT 5.1** | Emotional regulation, predictive empathy, context continuity |
| **Perplexity** | Retrieval + internet queries |
| **Any LLM via API** | Extendable architecture |

Spectra manages the **bandwidth, context, chunking, and routing** so the user never has to.

---

### **3. Social Input → Spectra → You (Not Your Brain)**
Every incoming message (social media, SMS, email, Discord, etc.) is funneled into Spectra.

Spectra shows you:

- **What the person is actually asking**  
- **The short answer you can send**  
- **Optional follow-up suggestions**  
- **Context you've been discussing elsewhere that might matter**  
- **A summary so you don’t have to recreate your mental map**

This prevents the neurodivergent fatigue of “Wait… where were we in the conversation?”

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Neurodivergent people communicate across **10+ channels** at once.  
Our context is **distributed**, but our working memory is not.

Spectra:

- tracks *everything*  
- keeps context stable  
- modulates emotional load  
- provides continuous recall  
- handles multi-channel overwhelm  
- lets you simply **talk** and let the AI-stack do the rest

This is the first communication OS designed around **how ND minds actually operate**.

## 🛣️ Future Vision (Phase 2+)

### **Hardware Integration**
- Neurable / EEG  
- AirPods Pro / bone conduction  
- Glasses HUD  
- Smart bracelets  
- Wearable emotion-sensing devices  

The long-term goal is a **fully integrated, real-time emotional co-regulation suit**.

## 🤝 Partnerships (Planned)

We intend to license IP + governance models to all major AI labs in exchange for:

- API access at cost  
- Token access at cost  
- Custom node capability  
- Technical support for multi-model orchestration  

Not competing.  
**Cooperating.**
